Super basic git repo so interested folks can pull request.
More to follow. There are a few additional files here that may
be of use to developers of the project.

* `mypi.ini` : config file for the mypy static type checker.
* `make-archive.sh` :
   Shell script to build the tarball that ships to
   customers. I've gotten rid of the `venv` directory for now.
* `watcher.sh` : A little shell script to help development of the PDF
   invoices. It basically just uses the `watch` command to watch the directory
   using `ls`. When anything changes it dies. Then the script regenerates
   the PDF. This is all done in a "while true" construct that loops forever.
   You'll need to hit Ctrl-C *twice* to kill it. The first one only kills
   the watch command within the script.

We've got some autogenerated docs now using Sphinx. Basically, it takes
the doctrings from the code and makes a searchable HTML website. To regenerate
these docs just do `sphinx-build -c sphinx/config/ -b html . sphinx/build/` in
directory. The generated docs are static HTML and CSS pages and do not require a server
though they can certainly be hosted on one. You can view them by just going
directly to the HTML file itself at `./sphinx/build/index.html`. The template
file for the index page is `index.rst` located in this directory. You can
change themes and many other parameters by editing `./sphinx/config/conf.py`
